Go Runnable Snippets
====================

This repo contain runnable Go snippets created for my personal learning tryouts to have a better understanding of standard packages or community libraries which I haven't been able to fully grasp reading their docs, hence I had to play with them for it, and I want them to be tracked for being able to read them when needed.

I created some of the snippets after I used the standard package or community library in professional development, but I wanted to have a basic isolated snippet for those.
